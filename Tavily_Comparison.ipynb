            "Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. Instead, these systems learn from data, identifying patterns and making decisions based on the information they process. The primary goal of machine learning is to enable machines to improve their performance on a specific task over time as they are exposed to more data.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Supervised Learning**:\n",
            "   - In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. The algorithm learns to map inputs to the correct outputs.\n",
            "   - **Examples**: \n",
            "     - Classification (e.g., spam detection in emails)\n",
            "     - Regression (e.g., predicting house prices based on features like size and location)\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Unsupervised Learning**:\n",
            "   - Unsupervised learning involves training a model on data that does not have labeled responses. The algorithm tries to learn the underlying structure or distribution in the data.\n",
            "   - **Examples**:\n",
            "     - Clustering (e.g., grouping customers based on purchasing behavior)\n",
            "     - Dimensionality reduction (e.g., reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving its structure)\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Semi-Supervised Learning**:\n",
            "   - This approach combines both labeled and unlabeled data for training. It is particularly useful when acquiring a fully labeled dataset is expensive or time-consuming.\n",
            "   - **Examples**: \n",
            "     - Image classification where only a small portion of images are labeled.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Reinforcement Learning**:\n",
            "   - In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions.\n",
            "   - **Examples**:\n",
            "     - Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo)\n",
            "     - Robotics (e.g., teaching a robot to navigate a maze)\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Deep Learning**:\n",
            "   - A specialized subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to model complex patterns in large datasets. Deep learning is particularly effective in tasks such as image and speech recognition.\n",
            "   - **Examples**:\n",
            "     - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing\n",
